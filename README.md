# DFEngine

DFEngine is a simple and versatile game engine written in C++. It is still under heavy initial development, and as such isn't yet recommended for normal use.

This project recently underwent a full rewrite to give it a slightly more sane architecture. As such, there are still a couple of bugs and missing features. The old repository can be found [here](http://github.com/DF458/DFEngine-Old-).
